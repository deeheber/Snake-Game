# Snake Game

## Description

This is the [classic snake game](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)>) written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) utilizing the [Turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) library.

You're the snake and need to eat the food to get points without hitting the edge of the screen or yourself. The more you eat, the longer you (as the snake) get.

1 point per piece of food eaten.
